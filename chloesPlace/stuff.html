            <p>In order to develop your own deck properly, you'd have to follow some steps:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <h3>BE DIDATIC</h3>
          <p>If you don't have the patience to do something that's didatic, let other ppl do it, so you can learn from them, but if youre good at teaching, your very welcome to stay here.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>BE REAL</h3>
          <p>This website is meant to be from you, and to you, so, its on your hands the decision of making this site either a great free learning place/spot or just a mere joke, and common, its meant to be good :)</p>
